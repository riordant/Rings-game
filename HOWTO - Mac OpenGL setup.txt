new OpenGL project in XCode Steps
Xcode 7 - el capitan

- new project -> osx -> application -> command line tool, C++
- click&drag .cpp files necessary
- when dragging files in, say "yes" to 'copy if necessary'
- go to project folder in directory: copy/paste 'include' from Dependancies folder, add extra files if necessary.
				       copy/paste 'lib' from Dependances folder, add extra files if necessary.
									 create "Shaders" folder and add shaders if necessary.
- adding dependancies: click project node:
					   build settings - search paths - header search paths - add "include/"
  					   build settings - Enable Modules (C and Objective-C) - No
  					   build settings - OS X Deployment Target - change to OS X 10.8 (not necessary but warnings otherwise)
  					   build phases - add iokit,cocoa,opengl,glut,corevideo, and then drag lib files from directory.

- in main file: include header files from file in "Dependancies" and add new ones necessary
			    uncomment windows stuff (DWORD, header files)
			    make sure addShaders has a correct full path to your shaders. eg. "/Users/...txt"
				add "GLUT_3_2_CORE_PROFILE|GLUT_DEPTH" in glutInitDisplayMode (mac profile/stops models appearing see-through)
				add "glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;" before glewInit is called
				sometimes have to add another VAO (if using her code. it's the way it's set up)
					do this before compilerShaders() is called.
					code: GLuint vao = 0;
    					  glGenVertexArrays (1, &vao);
    					  glBindVertexArray (vao);
				if model not appearing, make sure all other VAOs are using glGenVertexArrays(1,&{vao_name}); and are being bound.
